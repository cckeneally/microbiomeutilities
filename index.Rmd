**This package is in experimental stage and should be used with caution** 
I will keep improving this with time and feedback.  

# microbiomeutilities
This is mainly a _wrapper tool R package_.  

**Install microbiomeutilities**   

```{r, eval=FALSE}

install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("microsud/microbiomeutilities")

```  

**NOTE:**  
The aim of this package is not to replace any of the following tools, instead this package is useful for a quick and (not so) dirty analysis of the OTU tables/biom files generated by tools such as QIIME (the newer QIIME2) (Caporaso, Kuczynski, Stombaugh et al., 2010), Mothur (Schloss, Westcott, Ryabin et al., 2009), DADA2 (Callahan, McMurdie, Rosen et al., 2016). Use the _HTML_ report as a reference guide and not consider it as final results.      

## Why do this?  
I am a microbiologists and R enthusiast and some times, my free time activity includes combining these two. The learning curve is steep for analyzing microbiome data from scratch. This package includes codes that are used routinely by me and my colleagues and friends. Realizing that the entire process of analyzing microbiome data is iterative and requires investment of time for thorough analysis, it was useful for me to make a package which makes this a little simpler. This helps in planning better the individual analysis such as filtering, normalization, transformation (all three are topics of hot debate and disagreement). The ability to look quickly if the main factor of interest is having an impact on the community diversity, composition, structure can be useful. This will also helps in making better decisions for further in-depth analysis. 


## Direction for this package   
Depending on the real world usefulness, practicality and success, we plan to include complete or parts of this package in the `microbiome` R package.

The microbiome R package relies on the independently developed
